# Multi-class-Hate-Detection-in-Gujarati-social-media-Text
Gujarati Hate Speech Dataset  and classification model 


In a short span, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have dramatically increased their users. These platforms expand new horizons for people to express their views globally. Now, free speech over the internet is taking shape as a new fundamental right. The enormous usage of these mediums may lead to the propagation of hateful and offensive content resulting in cyberbullying while less relevant research in Gujarati social media text and unavailability of a dataset make Gujarati usersâ€™ online space more vulnerable even though Gujarati language has more than 60 million speakers globally. In this work, I present a new multi-class peer-reviewed labeled dataset of more than 5500 user comments and natural language processing algorithms to classify various categories of hate speech in Gujarati social-media text. I performed experiments on this researched dataset using naive byes, logistic regression, KNN for two classes, stochastic gradient descent, LinearSVC, and logistic regression for six classes. My key contribution is to make this dataset available for further research.
